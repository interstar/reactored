There is so much todo, but here are some pointers.

* Sinks we need to develop the following sink adaptors: Imap,Http,Xmpp,S3sink,GAEsink, a sink app that runs python scripts or enable python sink apps to be constructed.

* Identity adaptors : Oauth, LDAP

* Domain Applications : Tag application (to handle tagging under '/Tags' domain), A godd example app to show how reactor apps are built. A domain app that could run no native domain apps written in say python/ruby etc..

* ACL profiles :  I am working on at least one of these that works like the original rel3 demo app, we need to explore others.

* Add proper unicode support

* Unify runtime storage into config_server. It currently house basic static config values like home and domain. Bt other OTP parts are using ETS to store/register modues based data/state. It might be beneficial to integrate this seperately into config, using perhaps namespaces (domains) to store ETS data even accross instance perhaps.

* Extend unit test coverage

* Add REST tests (probably using jQuery)

* Documentation, I can only apologise for the lack of it, I really need help here.
